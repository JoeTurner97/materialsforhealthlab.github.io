Our Materials for Health Lab, is developing advanced materials for transformative sustainable healthcare. 
Specifically, to develop materials that can detect and diagnose the presence of disease at point-of-care. 
Health and Well-being is the third goal of the UN Sustainability Development Goals, and our research is 
seeking to contribute to sustaining healthcare, democratising healthcare and tackling the ever-increasing threat of antimicrobial resistance.


## Research Topics
Several material developments ongoing for several applications:

### Materials for Bacterial Infection Detection
- Epitope imprinted polymers (artificial antibody)

### Materials for Early Cancer Detection
-	Bioconjugation of biodegradable polymers for cancerous epitope detection

### Materials for Minimally Invasive Detection
-	Hydrogel microneedles development
-	Imprinted conductive nanoneedles

### Materials for Wound Dressings
-	Therapeutic composite fibres
-	De novo polypeptide fibres
