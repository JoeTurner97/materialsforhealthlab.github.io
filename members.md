		PhD Student Sept 2019- <br>
		<p style="color:black;font-size:14px;">Yasemin is a current PhD student working on "Multifunctional Devices for Rapid Point-of Diagnostics". This project is dedicated to the development of a novel multiplex platform biosensor device for the diagnosis of the onset of infection, with a specific focus on sepsis at the point-of-care to prevent the distribution of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Yasemin obtained a Chemistry (BSc) and a Chemical Research (MSc) from Queen Mary University of London with both degrees demonstrating a strong focus on biomaterials. The research projects concentrated on the synthesis of phosphate-based glasses for tissue engineering. </p>
